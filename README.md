# Cardputer_Shell
Compilation of 3D models of the M5Stack Cardputer. 

Until I finish creating the model, this repository is for renders of the final models. All models will be accurate within 2 decimal places to the shells that come from M5Stack. Once in the respoitory, they're yours to do with as you please, just give me some recognition for the initial creation.
